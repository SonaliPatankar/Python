# Lagrange Interpolation for Pressure-Temperature Relationship
This Python script demonstrates Lagrange interpolation to estimate pressure values at given temperature points.

## Description
Interpolation is a method used in mathematics and computational science to estimate values between known data points. In this script, we implement Lagrange interpolation to estimate pressure values at given temperature points based on a set of discrete data points.

## How it Works
The script defines a function lagrange_interpolation to perform Lagrange interpolation.
Sample data points for temperature and pressure are provided.
The user is prompted to enter a list of temperatures at which pressure is to be calculated.
The script interpolates pressure at the input temperatures using the Lagrange interpolation function.
The calculated interpolated pressure values are printed to the console.
The script plots the original data points and the interpolated points on a graph.

# Gaussian Elimination for Solving Linear Equations
This Python script solves a system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.

## Description
Gaussian elimination is a method used to solve systems of linear equations. This script implements Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, which is a technique to reduce errors due to floating-point arithmetic.

## How it Works
The script defines a function gauss_elimination to perform Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.
The user is prompted to enter values for the coefficient matrix and the constant matrix.
The script validates the input matrices and performs Gaussian elimination to find the solution vector.
The solution vector is displayed to the console.

## Parameters
a_matrix: Coefficient matrix of shape (n, n).
b_matrix: Right-hand side vector of shape (n, 1).
